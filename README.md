Here is the revised README with the special functions mentioned:

SuperModelToken

A simple ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity

Overview

This contract implements a basic token with minting and burning functionality. It has a fixed name ("SuperModel Token") and symbol ("SMT"), and a dynamic total supply that is updated when tokens are minted or burned.

Features

- Public variables for token name, symbol, and total supply
- Mapping of addresses to balances
- Mint function (mint(address addr, uint amount)) to increase total supply and balance of a given address
- Burn function (burn(address addr, uint amount)) to decrease total supply and balance of a given address, with a safety check to prevent burning more tokens than an address holds

Usage

- Deploy the contract to a blockchain network
- Use the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to an address
- Use the burn function to destroy tokens held by an address

Security Notes

- The burn function includes a require statement to prevent burning more tokens than an address holds
- This contract does not include any access control or authorization mechanisms - it is intended for demonstration purposes only

By highlighting the mint and burn functions, I've drawn attention to the two special functions that make this contract useful for creating and managing a token. Let me know if you'd like me to add anything else!
